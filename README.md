Mobile app for WakaTime

Built using the [http://ionicframework.com/](Ionic SDK), to be cross-platform on iOS and Android

Right now, this has very minimal functionality:

* Account screen where you can enter your WakaTime API key, which is necessary for the app to access your WakaTime data
* Stats screen, displaying last 7 days for projects and languages
